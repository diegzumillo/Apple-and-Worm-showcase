# Game in Unity - Apple & Worm: Patching holes on spacetime
## A showcase of the technical achievements of this project

Apple & Worm is a platformer that happens in a curved 2D space, where different regions connect to other regions in unintuitive ways. This creates a game space with non trivial topology. While the game itself is still in development the engine is done.

In order to achieve the curved and interconnected space the game design requires, several approaches were implemented and tested. Here you can see some images of the progress of the engine at its various stages.
